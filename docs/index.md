# Cell Segmentation Explorer

Bin2Cell Explorer is a TissUUmaps plugin that brings the interactive features from the original `Bin2Cell_demo.ipynb` notebook into the viewer. It lets scientists explore Bin2Cell-expanded labels on top of H&E imagery, switch between gene-expression and observation overlays, and export the rendered regions.
